# Interpolation-Terminology-Alert: Interactive Math Visualization

## Interactive Educational Tool for Understanding Interpolation Terminology

This interactive educational tool helps K-12 students grasp key terminology and concepts related to interpolation methods through visual, hands-on exploration. Students can see mathematical terms come to life as they manipulate data points and observe different interpolation techniques in action.

### Educational Benefits:
- Bridges the gap between abstract mathematical terms and visual understanding
- Reinforces vocabulary comprehension through interactive demonstration
- Provides clear definitions with matching visual representations
- Offers intuitive explanations of complex interpolation terminology
- Supports both visual and textual learning approaches

### Features:
- Interactive graph demonstrating key interpolation terminology
- Three interpolation methods with comprehensive terminology explanations
- Real-time visualization showing mathematical terms in action
- Prediction challenges to reinforce understanding of concepts
- Responsive design for use across educational devices
- Embeddable in ArcGIS StoryMaps for curriculum integration

### Integration with Curriculum:
This tool supports mathematics vocabulary development related to:
- Data interpolation techniques and terminology
- Mathematical modeling language
- Technical vocabulary for prediction methods
- Terms related to coordinate geometry
- Language of applied mathematics

### Technical Requirements:
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- No special plugins or installations required

### How to Use:
1. Visit the hosted version at [your-github-pages-url]
2. Click "Add Points" to place data points on the graph
3. See definitions update as you try different interpolation methods
4. Use "Practice" mode to test terminology comprehension
