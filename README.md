# MathQuest-Interpolate: Interactive Math Exploration

## Module 3: Discovering Interpolation Methods

This interactive educational tool helps K-12 students understand interpolation concepts through hands-on exploration and gamified learning. Students can visualize how different interpolation methods work by adding their own data points and seeing the results instantly.

### Educational Benefits:
- Builds intuition for mathematical modeling concepts
- Encourages prediction and hypothesis testing
- Visualizes abstract mathematical concepts
- Offers appropriate explanations for different grade levels
- Supports self-directed learning through experimentation

### Features:
- Interactive graph for adding and manipulating data points
- Three interpolation methods to compare and contrast
- Real-time visualization of interpolation results
- Prediction challenges to test understanding
- Clear explanations of mathematical concepts
- Responsive design for use on various devices
- Embeddable in ArcGIS StoryMaps for rich educational narratives

### Integration with Curriculum:
This tool supports STEM learning objectives related to:
- Data analysis and prediction
- Mathematical modeling
- Pattern recognition
- Coordinate geometry
- Applied mathematics

### Technical Requirements:
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- No special plugins or installations required

### How to Use:
1. Visit the hosted version at [your-github-pages-url]
2. Click "Add Points" to place data points on the graph
3. Try different interpolation methods and observe the results
4. Use "Practice" mode to test understanding through prediction challenges
